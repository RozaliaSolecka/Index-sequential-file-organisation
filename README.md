## About The Project
The aim of the project was to design and implement the indexed file organization. The project implemented index-sequential file organization. The following operations have been implemented: inserting, updating, reading, deleting a record, displaying the contents of a data file and index, browsing the entire file content in accordance with the order of key values, automatic and on-demand reorganization, reading commands from a test file. The program works in an interactive way. After downloading and executing the command, you can present its result and give another command.
